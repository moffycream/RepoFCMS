Feedback (Individual)
=====================
1. Gavin
What did you do yesterday?
- Tidy up, finish register page and do some designing based on updated theme for webpage
- Start on login page
- Start implementing forgot password feature for logging in

What will you do today?
- Continue working on forgot password 
- Further refine register page
- Implement security features (such as hashing password)

What (if anything) is blocking your progress?
- Due to job and club activity, less time for doing work
- Forgot password feature used a lot of time, because was researching into using framework's given features, but in the end decided not to use as it will require redo of alot of already done work (register page, navigation bar etc)
